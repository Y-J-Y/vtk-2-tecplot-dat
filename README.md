# .vtk to .dat convertor
This script can convert .vtk files to .dat files for viewing in Tecplot

## Usage:  Convert .xdmf / .vtr / .vtk to Tecplot .dat / .tec / .plt / .szplt
Though this script can only convert .vtk files to tecplot .dat, it can enable the above conversions.

How?
1. Open Paraview readable formats in Paraview. 
2. File>Save Data...>select format as .vtk
3. Keep in the .vtk and script in same folder and run script with appropriate filenames.
4. Open generated .dat file in tecplot. Recommended to save as .szplt.

Very limited testing done! Sucessfully converts a .vtk file generated by paraview from a 3d flow simulation snapshot to .dat file readable by tecplot. May need modifications to work with 2D plots, different type of grid, etc.
